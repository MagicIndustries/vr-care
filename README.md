# VR Care
Starting in late 2015, an interdisciplinary internal project team located in frog design's San Francisco studio teamed up with our healthcare design fellow, Dr. Brian Pridgen, a Stanford Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery resident, to design a low-cost headset and VR game experience suitable for burn wound care. The outcome of this passion project is an inexpensive headset prototype that is extremely affordable, easy to assemble, and feasible for use in the burn wound care environment. In addition to the headset, we developed an open-source game concept, “Ēpiónē”, for use by burn patients. Our hope is that it can serve as a platform or template that other developers could use to build additional VR experiences for patients. The game will allow the patient to remain appropriately positioned for burn wound care while being immersed in a distracting virtual reality environment.
